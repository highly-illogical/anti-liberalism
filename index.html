        A funny thing about modern anti-liberal movements is that though they
        are almost always at loggerheads with each other, they also bear strong
        similarities to each other.
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item text">
        These similarities remain obscured by the thick fog of stereotyping
        through which each of them perceives all the rest. But they are there.
        Take, for instance

        All other groups recognize and act in their own interest - only this
        group is too naive to do so, and is manipulated into believing this
        weakness to be virtue. If the state and its institutions are to be a
        force for good, they must be based upon the ideology that advocates for
        the interests of this group. Otherwise, they are oppressive, evil and
        worse than useless, for they enable the depraved groups of the world to
        dominate, subjugate and exploit the noble one.

        While there may often be more than a grain of truth to this, an
        exclusive focus on this narrative allows them to paint all of social and

        oppressor groups.

        All concepts of value have to be reinterpreted in terms of the basic
        conflict between the good group and the evil groups. "Freedom",

        otherwise it cannot be considered a value at all.
